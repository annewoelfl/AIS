1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the problem you are solving, the dataset used, and the type of task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
-->description see chat?
-->dataset danish accumulation of lots of AIS reports (maybe show distribution over a map)

2. **Literature Review**: Indicate solutions you've found that are related to your project.
--> see literatur review

3. **Dataset Characteristics**: Provide an overview of your dataset, including any preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
- steps: grouping by vessel; filtering by area; creating xxmin sets of equal Navigational Status (show little map tiles of the xx min sets)

4. **Baseline Model**: Quickly recap your baseline model, its performance, and why it was chosen.

5. **Model Definition and Evaluation**: Discuss the models you've implemented, the feature engineering steps you've taken, and how you evaluated their performance. Include a screenshot of the code you used to implement the model.

6. **Results**: Present the results in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Use tables, charts, or any other visual aids that you find appropriate.

7. **Challenges and Errors**: Discuss the most challenging issue or error you encountered during the data preparation or modeling phase, and how you overcame it.

8. **Discussion**: Reflect on the performance of your models compared to the baseline, and discuss any limitations and future work.

9. **Q&A**: Be prepared to answer questions from the audience or instructor.
